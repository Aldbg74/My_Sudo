Please note that copying and submitting the code in this repository as your own for Epitech projects is a violation of the school's academic integrity policy. <br>
Doing so can result in severe penalties such as a grade of -42 or even -84, as well as potential disciplinary actions. <br> 
Remember, the purpose of these projects is to learn and demonstrate your understanding of the material. <br>
Copying code undermines that goal and is detrimental to your own academic and professional development. <br>
Please respect the academic integrity policies of Epitech and uphold the principles of honesty and integrity in your work. <br>
I decline all responsibility if you cheat and get caught. <br>
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
